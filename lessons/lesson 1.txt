Lesson 1
    ////// LESSON #1: CHANGING THE SCALE OF YOUR SHIP //////

    //Delete the 2 forward slashes below and click Submit Code
    player.scaleTo(1,2,1);

    //When you delete the back slashes, the code should
    //light up with different colors.
    //Two forward slashes in front of code stops it from
    //running.
    //If your ship got bigger when you hit Submit Code,
    //Good job!

    //Go ahead and put the two slashes back in front of the
    //code again.

    //The code you just entered changed the scale of the
    //X, Y, and Z proportions of the ship.
    //Try changing the first variable to 1.5.  This is
    //the scale of the ship along the X axis which
    //is left to right.

    //Now try changing the second coordinate.

    //Experiment a bit with changing both the X and Y
    //coordinates. (You can't see changes to the Z
    //coordinate because it stretched between you and
    //computer screen)

    //Now click the middle of the screen and try
    //moving your ship with your left, right, and up
    //arrow keys.

    //You can fire by pressing the b key
