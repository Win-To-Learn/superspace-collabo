    var xScale = yScale = zScale = 2;
    player.scaleTo(xScale,yScale,zScale);

    //var means that you are creating a variable for the value
    //of the xScale, yScale, and zScale.
    //Change the value of all of these variables by just
    //changing the 2 to a 1.  Click Submit.

    //If you were using numbers for the scale instead of using
    //variables you would have to change each of the scale numbers
    //individually.
