    //“translate” is a math term for move
    //the code about moves you 200 units to the right
    //and 100 units up from the the center at 0,0

    //the first number is the x coordinate
    //the second number is the y coordinate

    //the third number is the z coordinate but
    //keep this at 0 since this is a 2d game

    //(the y is reverse from what you are used to)
    //(negative y is down, and positive y is up)

    //look at the coordinates on the minimap and change
    //the x, and y to help zip around!
