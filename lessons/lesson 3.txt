    var scale = 0.5;
    var delayMs = 300;
    var i = 0;
    var timingInterval = setInterval(function(){
		if(i < 20) {
			scale = scale + 0.01*i;
			player.scaleTo(scale,scale,scale);
			i++;
		}
		else {
			clearInterval(timingInterval);
		}
    }, delayMs);

    //Ignore the timing interval for now, and let's just
    //focus on the "loop" on lines 74 to 78
    //Experiment changing the value of the scale variable
    //and the delayMs variable.

    //This is an advanced coding loop but it basically
    //creates a timer that runs a function every 300
    //milliseconds.  It fires the function on this timing
    //interval 20 times.
    //The if statement is called a conditional.  It
    //basically means that while a certain condition
    //is true, do something.  In this case if a counter
    //named "i" is less than 20, do something and then
    //increase the the counter by 1 and see if it is
    //still less than 20.
