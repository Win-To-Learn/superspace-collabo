    //“translate” is a math term for move
    //the code about moves you to the lower right corner

    //the first number is the x coordinate
    //the second number is the y coordinate

    //(the y is reverse from what you are used to)
    //(negative y is down, and positive y is up)

    //look at the coordinates on the minimap and change
    //the x, and y to help zip around!
