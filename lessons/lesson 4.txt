    //////    LESSON #4: CREATING A NEW ORB OBJECT    //////
    //////                                            //////

    new Orb(1.5);

    //The code above creates a new "Orb" object.  Orbs are defined
    //to simulate asteroids that float around in space and have
    //density and are affected by gravity.  They bounce off each
    //other but can destroy your ship when then collide with you.
    //If you happened to collide with one and were destroyed,
    //check out the next lesson to recreate your ship.
