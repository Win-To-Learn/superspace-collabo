    //the code above uses a timer and loop
    //every 1000 milliseconds it checks if it has
    //gone through the loop 10 times yet.
    //the variable i keeps track of the number of loops
    //if i is less than 10, you are moved to x and y
    //coordinates that are 100 times whatever i is.
    //try editing the numbers above to constantly
    //avoid your pursuer.

    //google Math.random() and see if you can figure
    //out how to translate to random coordinates
