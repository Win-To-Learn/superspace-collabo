    //The code above creates a new "Player" object.
    //The code is a little more complicated because when you
    //first access this website, you are assigned a special
    //"clientId".  This id lets the server know who you are
    //as distinct from other players that log on.
    //Since you have a unique id, when you do something,
    //the server can tell the other players what you did
    //and make your actions or movements show up on their screen
    //The rotation code makes the ship show up at a 90 degree
    //angle.
