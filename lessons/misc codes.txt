    //The code above creates a new "Player" object.
    //The code is a little more complicated because when you
    //first access this website, you are assigned a special
    //"clientId".  This id lets the server know who you are
    //as distinct from other players that log on.
    //Since you have a unique id, when you do something,
    //the server can tell the other players what you did
    //and make your actions or movements show up on their screen
    //The rotation code makes the ship show up at a 90 degree
    //angle.


    //to create a new Hydra at x = 0, y = 0
    //you will need to use a command to create a new object like
    //in lesson 5 except instead of giving the function the radius
    //of an orb, you will give it the coordinates of the Hydra
    //in the format (0,0)



    //secret super laser upgrade

    //to upgrade you laser, you will have to use dot notation
    //and access the properties bulletSpread (the angle within which the lasers are fired)
    //and bulletCount (the number of bullets fired each time)
    //of the player object

    //the code will start like player.
    //and the you will have to add the properties at the end
    //and set them equal to the values you want

    //the code below sets the bulletSpread

    //player.bulletSpread = 40;

    //you will have to write the code for the bullet count below here
