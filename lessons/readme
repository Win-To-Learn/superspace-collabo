Create a new .txt file here and it will
be loaded into the lesson list.

The first row of this lesson file should
contain label of the lesson, and optionally
the priority it should gain in the list,
separated by ';'. If priority is omitted, it
will be given a priority of 1000.

For example:
Lesson 1;20

Would give the lesson a label "Lesson 1",
and a priority of 20. That means that all
lessons that have priority <20 will appear
before this one in the list.

If there were 8 files, which began with

Practise;1
Advanced techniques;20
Last advice
Practise 2;1
Hello world;0
Extra;21
Practise 1;1
Next practise;2

the resulting lesson list in the browser
would read:

Hello world
Practise
Practise 1
Practise 2
Next practise
Advanced techniques
